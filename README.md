## Important note:
I am mostly contributing to private projects. Usaly this would be shown in my contribution graph. However most, if not all, private projects are collaborations with my brother. For easier managing access we are using the free tier of githubs organizations feature. Right now most of these are private. This puts limitations on GitHub collecting data for the contribution graph.

If you want to have a look at the code/projects within the organizations feel free to contact me and we can work something out.
