## Important note:
I am mostly contributing to private projects. Usaly this would be shown in my contribution graph. However most, if not all, private projects are collaborations with my [brother](https://github.com/engineerTrooper). For easier managing access we are using the free tier of githubs organizations feature. This puts limitations on GitHub collecting data for the contribution graph.

If you want to have a look at the code/projects within the organizations feel free to contact me and we can work something out.
